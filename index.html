What’s interesting about SONA’s website is that it appears as a hidden veil to a heightened, eclectic dining experience. Elegant and clean, it leaves visitor’s imagining a boisterous atmosphere full of decadent food. Browsing through their menus is one way to be transported behind the doors of SONA.

          <p class="texto">Although Roman’s has partnered with BentoBox since 2018, the beloved Brooklyn-based restaurant recently went through a website refresh (BentoBox customers receive a complimentary redesign every 3 years). Roman’s aligns itself with local farmers and producers to serve ‘reverent Italian-influenced food’. Unpretentious and subtle, the new website features a unique, graph paper background. For brevity, the homepage immediately features the lunch and dinner menus which are updated daily. Visitors can <a href="https://getbento.com/features/restaurant-website-design/" class="linktxt">quickly call the restaurant with one click</a> or simply make a reservation through the integration with Resy.</p>

Their new website is simplistic, yet refined. Beautiful imagery of scrumptious pastries and tempting deli items entice hungry visitors. The defined “Order Now” button in the navigation all but seals the deal to convince visitors to place orders for pickup and delivery all without leaving the website.</p>

          <p class="texto">Anton’s is a nostalgic New York café whose cuisine celebrates the rich culinary history of its New York City with deep European influences. Their website evokes a neo-classical feel with the use of italicized serif typefaces alongside beautiful photography of their cuisine and interiors. Anton’s use of a side navigation allows visitors to quickly <a href="https://getbento.com/features/restaurant-website-design/" class="linktxt">browse through their menus, hours and press</a> articles. The website uses highlighted buttons as a call to action, so guests can quickly reserve a table or even to subscribe to their e-newsletters.</p>

          <p class="texto">Located in Los Angeles’ Arts District, Damian is firmly rooted in Mexican culture and cuisine with a focus on seasonality using the best of California’s produce. Damian is the twin concept to <a href="https://www.cosmenyc.com/" class="linktxt">Cosme</a> — a celebrated restaurant in New York City. Renowned chef and owner, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enriqueolveraf/?hl=en" class="linktxt">Enrique Olvera</a> takes a new approach to how guests experience Mexican cuisine at Damian and evidence of this is directly reflected through their website. Delightedly minimal in its approach, “Damian” is boldly written on the left-hand side of the desktop version of their website alongside an image showcasing their stark, minimalist interior. Visitors can simply navigate through the site by scrolling, revealing their about section, food and drink menus and critically important contact and location information. Whether it’s to make reservations or purchase a digital gift card, visitors can do so through the website with ease.</p>

          <p class="texto">Life Is Short, Eat Ice Cream. This is the tagline for Dasher and Crank, one of Miami's finest ice cream shops. It’s also one of the first things you see on its website. We couldn’t agree more. The website stands out from the competition with a pastel pink and blue color palette and a sticky navigation bar that is designed to resemble melted ice cream. The online store sells branded pink t-shirts and hats, driving additional revenue on top of new patrons.</p>

Their website is clean and modest, with full-bleed images of the interiors that allude to the unique dining experience. A highlighted “Online Ordering” button takes visitors to their <a href="https://getbento.com/features/online-ordering/" class="linktxt">online ordering store</a> where they can purchase food for pickup and delivery, directly through their website.</p>

          <p class="texto">What started in 2014 as a food cart, parked on the sidewalk in front of a local Vancouver brewery, has since grown into a brick and mortar restaurant with an operating food truck. Disco Cheetah Korean Grill serves up bright, bold Korean dishes and their website embodies the radiant aspect of Korean cuisine. Visitors can inquire about booking the food truck for an event, but the most unique feature is their <a href="https://getbento.com/blog/why-we-built-online-ordering-for-restaurants/" class="linktxt">online ordering store</a> with mouth-watering photography of their to-go dishes.</p>

          <p class="texto">Federalist Pig is one of Washington, DC’s most iconic barbecue joints — so much so that it was featured in an episode of Netflix's House of Cards. Its website is a feast for the senses, including bright colors, cheeky line illustrations and mouthwatering food photography. Despite how loud and eye-catching the design system is, the site itself is clean, well-structured and easy to navigate.
